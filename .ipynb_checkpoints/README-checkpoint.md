# Predicting Housing Prices with Chatgpt

For this data project, I wanted to experiment with the capabilities of ChatGPT Plus (GPT 4) to create an ML model that predicts the sale price of a common housing data set: __[Ames Iowa Housing Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcopale/housing?resource=download)__

### TL;DR
1. Using ChatGPT, I was able to create a better performing model in about ~30 minutes vs. the week it took me when first encountering this __[project years ago.](https://github.com/Jmizraji/Predicting-Housing-Prices)__ (This tool is incredible!)

- ChatGPT: RMSE - \$14,148.48 and a coefficient of determination (R² score) of 0.965
- Old Project: RMSE - \$29\,000.98 and a coefficient of determination (R² score) of 0.897

(RMSE explains on average, how far the predictions are away from the actual values.)

2. Exploratory analysis is a breeze, speeding up any data professional's time to insights

3. In a real world scenario, this won't automate the full process of building ML models, but it will certainly help play an integral part of speeding up the process. Humans are still needed to understand what models are valuable to a business, communicate the value to stakeholders, how to extract the data, what data to include in a model, monitor how it performs on new data, how to best scale it, etc.
